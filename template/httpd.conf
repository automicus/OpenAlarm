    <!-- 
    WARNING: MODIFY THIS FILE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

    The following configuration is highly recomended.
    This configuration will only allow the local host
    to connect to and execute command through the 
    openAlarm web interface. It is highly recomended 
    that you do not expose openAlarm to untrusted 
    networks, such as the internet, as there is no
    security built into openAlarm.

    It is safe to change the port, if needed, provided 
    that the ip entry does not change.
